Here's an example of a `README.md` file for your `todo_management_app` project using Riverpod, MVVM structure, and Sqflite for the database, with Hive for cache memory:

```markdown
# Todo Management App

This is a Todo Management App built with Flutter, using the Riverpod state management library, MVVM architecture, Sqflite for the database, and Hive for cache memory.

## Summary

The Todo Management App allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored locally using Sqflite, and Hive is used for caching data to improve performance. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete
- Local storage with Sqflite
- Caching with Hive
- Riverpod for state management
- MVVM architecture
